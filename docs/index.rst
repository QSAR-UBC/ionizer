The Ionizer
===========

The Ionizer is a set of tools for transpiling and optimizing PennyLane circuits
into native trapped-ion gates.

These documentation pages focus on usage of the transpilation tools. Technical
details and intuition about trapped ion gates can be found in this `PennyLane
blog post
<https://pennylane.ai/blog/2023/06/the-ionizer-building-a-hardware-specific-transpiler-using-pennylane/>`_
about the Ionizer, and IonQ's documentation page, `Getting started with Native
Gates <https://ionq.com/docs/getting-started-with-native-gates>`_.
